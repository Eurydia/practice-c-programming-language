// Exercises:
// 1. Implement the substring function. Read https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substring.
// 2. Write a program that reads a string from the standard input and counts the
//    number of characters and words in it! Use the `fgets()` function to read.
// 3. Write a program that reads a second string and compares it with the previous
//    one! Do the task with a built-in operation from the `string.h` library, and
//    without it.
// 4. Copy the previous string into a third string! Complete the task with or
//    without a built-in action.
// 5. Create a string as an array of characters and one as a pointer! Try to
//    replace one character in both versions! What is the difference between the
//    two?
// 6. Create a text file with any text. Write a program in which you open the file
//    using the `fopen()` function and read the contents of the file by calling the
//    `fgets()` function. Convert the scanned text to all uppercase letters and
//    write the uppercase text to the standard output! After reading, close the
//    file with the `fclose()` function.
// 7. Complete the previous task by writing the uppercase text not to the standard
//    input, but to another file, using the `fprintf()` function. Use the `fopen()`
//    function to create a new file as well. [Use rewind(cfPtr); to reset the file position pointer]
// 8. Create two new files containing the same number of arbitrary numbers. Read
//    the numbers from both files in parallel and write their product in a third
//    file! To scan, use the `fscanf()` function.
// 9. Check which of the learned reading functions are suitable for reading
//    characters one by one from the standard input!
// 10. Write a program that determines whether a string is a palindrome.
// 11. Write a program that determines how many consonants and vowels there are in
//     the entered text! (We only use the letters of the English alphabet.)
// 12. Try to find out how many bytes are stored if you read the word
//     "árvíztűrőtükörfúrógép" into a character array!
