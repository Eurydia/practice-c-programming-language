# Tasks

Exercises:
- [x] 0. Create a program which determine whether or not two numbers are Amicable. (Check: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amicable_numbers)
- [x] 1. Write the real numbers from 0 to 1 in increments of 0.1.
- [x] 2. Write out a 10x10 times table. Separate the numbers in a line with tab
   characters.
- [x] 4. Write out how many bytes your computer represents an `int`, `long int`,
   `unsigned int`, `unsigned long int`, `char`, `bool`, `float`, `double`,
   `long double` value.
- [ ] 5. Try operator chaining (a < b < c, a = b = c).
- [x] 6. Write a program that determines whether the number is a leap year from the
 standard input. A leap year is any year divisible by four, except those
 divisible by a hundred. However, those divisible by four hundred will also be
 leap years. (DO NOT use `if` in the solution!)
- [x] 7. Create a program which prints the greatest/lowest element of an array. (DO NOT sort the array)
- [x] 8. Create a program which swaps the smallest and greatest elements of an array.
- [x] 9. Create a program which calculates the length of a string.
- [x] 10. Calculate the average of some floating point numbers in an array.
- [x] 11. Create a program which calculates the weighted sum of an array. The weights
   are listed in another array. For example: first array: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5],
   second array: [1, 1, 2, 3, 5]. Weighted sum: 1*1 + 1*2 + 2*3 + 3*4 + 5*5.
- [x] 12. Read the characters `0-9`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `d`, `e`, `f`. Give an error
   message for everything else. Interpret the number as hexadecimal and convert
   it to base 10. Use character to digit conversion. Use (https://www.tutorialspoint.com/how-to-convert-hexadecimal-to-decimal)
- [x] 13. Given an odd integer number, prints the "X" pattern. Sample input: 11
Output: 
      X - - - - - - - - - X 
      - X - - - - - - - X - 
      - - X - - - - - X - - 
      - - - X - - - X - - - 
      - - - - X - X - - - - 
      - - - - - X - - - - - 
      - - - - X - X - - - - 
      - - - X - - - X - - - 
      - - X - - - - - X - - 
      - X - - - - - - - X - 
      X - - - - - - - - - X 

- [x] 14. Prints the patterns: Star Pyramid Pattern, Diamond and Full Star Diamond Pattern :).
- [] 15. Do some research about bitwise operations and their usage:
