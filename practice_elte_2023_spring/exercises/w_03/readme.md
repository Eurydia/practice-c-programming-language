# Tasks

Exercises:
- [x] 1. Create a program that reads two integers from the user and print them in ascending order. Try It with 3 numbers! (if statment, swap, min and max functions)
- [x] 2. Given an integer number, prints the corresponding power of 2. (math function - bitwise).
- [x] 3. Create a program that reads an integer x, 10 <= x <= 99 and prints It with his digits inverted. (modulos)
- [x] 4. For an input in the format "HH:MM", check whether or not It if valid and convert It to seconds. HH -> Hour, MM -> Minute.
- [x] 5. How many even numbers do we have from 0 to a given integer? (Use for loop and while => Try with do ... while as well)
- [x] 6. What are the divisors of a number?
- [x] 7. Prints the sum of numbers from 0 to 100 with and without math formula. (Try sum of prime numbers)
- [x] 8. Prints a number in form of a prime factorization.
- [x] 9. Prints the Fibonacci sequence and its (n - 1)th term. Note: n > 1.
0 1 1 2 3 5 8 13 ...
- [x] 10.  Given an integer 12345, prints 54321. Check If It is palindrome and try to print it without the middle digit "3".
- [x] 11.  Calculate the greatest common divisor of two positive integers. (Use )
Try least common multiple as well.
