3. Declare an `int` variable. Calculate the largest value that can be stored in
   it. Give the variable this number as its value, then add one in a subsequent
   statement. Print the increased value.
4. (Bonus - Useful application) Forty students were asked to rate the quality of the food in the student cafeteria on a
scale of 1 to 10 (1 means awful and 10 means excellent). Place the 40 responses in an
integer array and summarize the results of the poll.

Exercises (Pointers, arrays):
- [x] 1. Change the value of a variable via a pointer.
- [x] 2. Change the value of a pointer through a pointer to a pointer. Then change the
   value pointed by the pointed pointer as well!
- [x] 3. Can you create a pointer to itself? What would be its type? Why not? Compare
   the sizes of pointers to different types of variables. Explain why the result
   is logical!
- [x] 4. Write a function that returns the sum of the elements in an array received as
   a parameter. The array is passed using a pointer to the first element and an
   integer variable containing a length. Let's write the function without using
   the `operator[]`, using pointer arithmetic. Is it possible to find the size
   of the array inside the function without the variable containing the length?
- [x] 5. Redesign the previous function so that we get the array using a pointer to
   the first element and a pointer to the last element. What happens if we
   overindex by one? (int* p = begin; p <= end; p++) What happens if we overindex by more?
- [x] 6. Redesign the previous program to calculate an average. How can we calculate
   the size of the array from the pair of pointers?
- [ ] 7. What happens when a function returns a pointer to a local variable that is
   dereferenced?
- [ ] 8. Let's dereference a null pointer. What is the result?
- [ ] 9. Explain why the `operator&` is needed in the case of `scanf()` when reading
   into an integer variable.
- [x] 10. Write a function that, from two pointers pointing inside the same array,
    decides which one points to an element with a smaller index.
- [x] 11. Write a function that returns a pointer to the maximum element of an array
    received as a parameter. What is the advantage and disadvantage of this
    compared to returning an index?
- [ ] 12. Can we apply the function written in the previous task to half of an array?
    How?
- [ ] 13. Can we apply the function written in the previous task to a single variable,
    as if it were an array with one element?
- [ ] 14. A function can also return a value using a return value or a pointer (e.g.
    `scanf()`). When should you use which one? What are the
    advantages/disadvantages of the methods?
